```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
datatariff <- readRDS("~/Dropbox/1-RA/PythonWTO/CHNtariff.rds")
```

## Tariff Analysis for China

Some graphs and tables for China
```{r datatariff}
tapply(datatariff$MFN, datatariff$Year, summary)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
