# How to prepare and submit your reports

Prepare your reports using RMarkdown, so that they are fully reproducible, carefully integrating visual and numerical evidence with prose.  You may work solo, or in groups of 4 or fewer people.  If you're working in a group, please turn in a single submission with all of your names attached.

To submit, please e-mail <ajlee@utexas.edu> with the subject line "ECO 395 Exercises N: name here" where N is the exercise number as appropriate (1, 2, etc.) And obviously use your own name in the subject, or the names of all your group members if applicable.

Your e-mail should have two links in it: 
1) A link to a GitHub page where the final report has been stored in Markdown format (PDF is acceptable in a pinch, but definitely not HTML -- it doesn't render properly on GitHub.)  
2) A link to the raw .Rmd file that can be used to reproduce your report from scratch.

If you need to include mathematical expressions in your report, you can use Markdown's [math syntax](https://github.com/cben/mathdown/wiki/math-in-markdown).  Alternatively, you can just handwrite the math, snap a photo, and include the image in the final report.  This is a simple, low-overhead option.

Note: if you know LaTeX, this is a perfectly acceptable alternative to Markdown (although you are probably creating more work for yourself, since RMarkdown is so east).  If you wish to typeset your reports in Latex, use Sweave or something similar and submit a PDF.  If you don't kow what Sweave is, either do some digging and find out, or don't use Latex :-)
